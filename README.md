Hey, you! Yeah, you! Come here! Hurry. We don't have much time. The fruits... they've gotten stronger. They'll take over any minute now. Here, take this sword. Get to work!

Behold! A new and improved version of the fan favorite, "Fruit Ninja." In Fruit Slicer, players will be taking on the role of a ninja, tasked with saving the world from the evil fruits that are raining down on the planet.

Once the game starts, fruits will begin falling from the sky (above the window). The player will need to click and drag their mouse/trackpad across the fruit in order to slice it in half. Fruits that are successfully sliced will not do any damage to our planet. However, if the fruit reaches the ground (bottom of the screen) before the player is able to slice it, then it will do siginificant damage to the Earth (and the player will lose a life). If three fruits reach the ground, life as we know it will cease to exist (the game will end). Do you have what it takes to save the world?

In Fruit Slicer, players will be able to:

Interact with the game canvas (click and drag their mouse)
Toggle music on/off using a mute button
Keep track of their score (scoreboard)
Keep track of which level their on, with difficulty increasing as the game progresses
Keep track of how many lives they have left (bottom corner of the screen)

The technologies that I plan on using are: Webpack (to compile all of my files) and canvas (to create the game board, fruits, etc.)

Implemenetation Timeline: create game canvas, create fruits, add falling logic to fruits, add ability to slice (remove) fruit from screen on click & drag,

Friday Afternoon & Weekend: Create game canvas & fruits
Monday: Implement falling logic for the fruits
Tuesday: Add ability for users to slice (remove) fruit from screen on click & drag
Wednesday: Add logic for increasing difficulty and levels, as well as lives/game over logic and and score
Thursday Morning: Add toggle music button, add finishing touches for CSS
